RewardsService
==============

A small sample showing how to put together a basic API using Ruby on Rails with versioning and token authentication. The use case is specifying a reward service for customers that have subscribed to different channels.

This has been built using Ruby v2.1.4 and Rails v 4.1.6.

JBuilder is used to build the JSON responses and testing is done using RSpec with Mocha (as the mock framework) and FactoryGirl (as the test data framework).
